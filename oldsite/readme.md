old project that i was taking a part.

basic tasks:


i'm not sure if approach that we have at ph-st project is still on the edge of frontend development, but at least it working as we suppose, so
we can grab that logic. or i'll ask eugene to guide us with it.

can this shit be compilable?

replace with bower?

use smacss

update to BS4 

get rid of jquery

validation, tests, etc.

js should be ES6-7 + we need babel-cli or webpack for packing everything together.

later we'll be able to grab more pages from PHP website.

can it be like frala design blocks? or replaced with their blocks completely?

also we need to make it less blackish...
